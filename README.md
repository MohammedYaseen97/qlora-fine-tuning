# qlora-fine-tuning
Experiment to train Llama-3.2 model for multi-turn conversations using QLoRA

## Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune the Llama-3.2 language model for improved performance in multi-turn conversations using the QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) technique.

### Key Features:

- **Model**: Llama-3.2, a variant of the Llama language model family by Meta AI
- **Task**: Multi-turn conversation improvement
- **Technique**: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Goal**: Enhance model's ability to maintain context and coherence across multiple dialogue exchanges

## What's in the Notebook

The accompanying Jupyter notebook contains:

1. Setup and installation of required libraries
2. Loading and preparation of the Llama-3.2 model
3. Data preprocessing for multi-turn conversation datasets
4. Implementation of QLoRA fine-tuning
5. Training loop and hyperparameter configurations
6. Example outputs and test cases
